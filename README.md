# Wordle_helper
A little helper that filters your dictionary to only contain the words still possible in a given wordl game, and scores those words to shows the word which gives you most information first

# how to use
Essentially, you just need to run the main.py file, run all cells and eventually get to the tried word function. If you run this, it will ask you which word you tried and which
information you obtained from the word. This will update the dictionary used and score them again, to give you the top words to put in next.
